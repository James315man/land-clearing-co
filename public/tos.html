        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to Clear Woods Crew. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the website <a
                href="https://clearwoodsnc.com">clearwoodsnc.com</a> and the services provided by Clear Woods Crew
            ("we,"
            "us," or "our"). By requesting a quote, hiring us for services, or using our website, you agree to these
            Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Services Provided</h2>
        <p>Clear Woods Crew provides land clearing, brush clearing, forestry mulching, and fire mitigation services in
            the
            greater south Raleigh area (including Willow Spring, Fuquay-Varina, and surrounding towns). All services are
            performed using our mechanized equipment (including a compact track loader and forestry mulcher head) to
            process vegetation on-site without the use of burn piles or hauling.</p>

        <h2>2. Quotes and Estimates</h2>
        <p>Quotes provided over the phone, via email, or in person are estimates based on the information provided or
            the
            visual inspection of the property. While we strive to provide flat-rate, accurate quotes, the final price
            may
            be subject to change if the scope of work significantly differs from the initial assessment (e.g., hidden
            debris, extreme terrain, or changes requested by the property owner). All adjustments will be communicated
            and
            agreed upon before proceeding.</p>

        <h2>3. Property Lines and Access</h2>
        <p>It is the sole responsibility of the property owner ("Client") to accurately identify and mark property lines
            prior to the commencement of any work. Clear Woods Crew will not be held liable for any clearing, damage, or
            incidental work performed on neighboring properties due to unmarked or inaccurately marked boundaries.</p>
        <p>The Client must also ensure clear access to the work area for heavy equipment. Clear Woods Crew is not
            responsible for incidental damage to driveways, turf, or underground utilities (e.g., sprinkler systems,
            unseen
            cables) that are not properly marked and communicated prior to the start of work.</p>

        <h2>4. On-Site Mulching Acknowledgment</h2>
        <p>By hiring Clear Woods Crew, you acknowledge that our primary method of operation is forestry mulching. This
            process leaves a layer of woody mulch and organic material on the ground. We do not haul away debris, and we
            do not utilize burn piles. The aesthetic of the finished product will be a mulched forest floor or pasture,
            which will naturally decompose over time.</p>

        <h2>5. Payment Terms</h2>
        <p>Payment is due upon completion of the agreed-upon services unless alternative arrangements have been
            contracted
            in writing prior to the start date. We accept standard forms of payment including check, cash, and
            designated
            electronic payments.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Clear Woods Crew is fully licensed and insured. However, to the maximum extent permitted by law, our
            liability
            for any claims relating to our services is limited to the total amount paid by the Client for the services
            rendered. We are not liable for unforeseeable or indirect damages.</p>

        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>All content on the Clear Woods Crew website, including text, logos, before/after photographs, and branding,
            is
            the intellectual property of Clear Woods Crew. It may not be copied, reproduced, or used without our
            explicit
            written permission.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to the Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time to reflect changes in our services or legal
            requirements. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
